# Simple Installation

To get MFC running as fast as possible without having to configure the
dependencies yourself, you can follow the following steps on most UNIX-like
systems. This method is best suited for development and Continous Integration
(CI) workflows.

To fetch, build, and run MFC and its dependencies on a UNIX-like system, you
must have installed common utilities (Tar, Wget, GNU Make, ...), Python2,
Python3, Python's developement headers and libraries, a C/C++ compiler
((GCC and G++) or Clang), an MPI Fortran compiler
(like [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)). Here are some commands for popular
Operating Systems and package managers, 

Package Manager                                            | Suggested Command 
---                                                        | ---
[Aptitude](https://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude) (Debian-like) | `sudo apt install tar wget make cmake gcc g++ python3 openmpi-*  python python-dev python3-dev libopenmpi-dev`
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (macOS)                       | `brew install wget make python open-mpi make cmake gcc`

The following commands fetch and build MFC and its required dependencies. The dependencies are built 
to the `dependencies/build/` directory within your MFC installation. This should have no impact on your
local installation(s) of these packages.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC
cd MFC/dependencies
./install.sh -j <num_threads>
cd ..
make -j <num_threads>
make tests
```

# Advanced Installation

MFC is split into 3 components with (mostly) layered dependencies. The following
table can be used to resolve the minimal amount of packages you are required to
install and configure depending on your specific use case.

Codes             | Description                             | Required Packages
----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---
Pre process Code  | "The pre-processor generates initial conditions and spatial grids from the physical patches specified in the Python input file andexports them as binary files to be read by the simulator." [1] | <ul><li>UNIX Utilities</li><li>GNU Make</li><li>C/C++ Compiler</li><li>Fortran MPI Compiler</li><li>[Python](https://www.python.org/)</li>
Simulation Code   | "The simulator, given the initial-condition files generated bythe pre-processor, solves the corresponding governing flowequations with the specified boundary conditions using ourinterface-capturingnumericalmethod." [1] | <ul><li>[FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/)</li></ul>
Post process Code | "The post-processor reads simulation data and exports HDF5/Silo databases that include variables and derived variables, asspecifiedintheinputfile." [1] | <ul><li>[HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/)</li><li>[Silo](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/silo)*</li></ul>

<sup>*Please note that <a href="https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/silo">Silo</a> depends on <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/">HDF5</a>.

Once you have decided on which dependencies you want to install, you can:

- Build them from source
- Obtain them through your package manager
- Modify and run the [install.sh](dependencies/install.sh) script above

You can now modify the [Makefile.user](Makefile.user) file at the root of MFC's 
source tree to specify the paths to those packages' binaries and header files, 
as well as to supply additional command line arguments.

Variable           | Description
------------------ | ---
`FC`               | Binary to execute to compile and preprocess Fortran files.
`FFLAGS`           | Command-line arguments to supply to your Fortran compiler of choice.
`fftw_lib_dir`     | Path to the parent folder containing [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/)'s binaries (/lib).
`fftw_include_dir` | Path to the parent folder containing [FFTW](https://www.fftw.org/)'s header files (/include).
`silo_lib_dir`     | Path to the parent folder containing [Silo](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/silo)'s binaries (/lib).
`silo_include_dir` | Path to the parent folder containing [Silo](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/silo)'s header files (/include).

You can now run `make -j <num_threads>` on MFC to build it, and check your installation by running tests with `make tests`.

```
make -j <num_threads>
make tests
```

# Running

The MFC can be run by changing into
a case directory and executing the appropriate Python input file.
Example Python input files can be found in the 
`example_cases` directories, and they are called `input.py`.
Their contents, and a guide to filling them out, are documented
in the user manual. A commented, tutorial script
can also be found in [example_cases/3d_sphbubcollapse/](example_cases/3D_sphbubcollapse/)
MFC can be executed as  

```
./input.py pre_process
```

which will generate the restart and grid files that will be read 
by the simulation code. Then  

```
./input.py simulation
```

will execute the flow solver. The last (optional) step
is to post treat the data files and output HDF5 databases
for the flow variables via  

```
./input.py post_process
```
