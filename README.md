## Installing MFC

To get MFC running as fast as possible without having to configure the dependencies yourself, you can follow the following steps on most UNIX-like
systems. 
This method is best suited for development and Continous Integration (CI) workflows.

To fetch, build, and run MFC and its dependencies on a UNIX-like system, you must have installed common utilities such as GNU's Make, Python3, its developement headers and libraries, a C/C++ compiler
(GCC, NVHPC, etc., but *not Clang*), and an MPI wrapper (like Open MPI). 
Below are some commands for popular operating systems and package managers.

### \*nix

* Via [Aptitude](https://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude)
```
sudo apt install tar wget make cmake gcc g++ python3 openmpi-*  python python-dev python3-dev libopenmpi-dev
```

### MacOS (including x86 and M1/Apple Silicon)

* Via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew install wget make python make cmake gcc
```

To install `open-mpi` for a brew-installed `gcc`, you will need to set the following environment variables before the brew install:
```
HOMEBREW_CC=gcc-11; HOMEBREW_CXX=g++-11; brew install open-mpi
```
where one can change the `-11` portion to match the installed `gcc-?` version. 
You can read more about this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27930481/how-to-build-openmpi-with-homebrew-and-gcc-4-9).
This is required because MacOS now ships with the `gcc` commmand mapped to `clang` and `brew` does not like messing with this.
We do *not* support `clang` due to conflicts with our Silo dependency.

### Fetch and build MFC

The following commands fetch and build MFC and its required dependencies. 
The dependencies are built to the `dependencies/build/` directory within your MFC installation. 
This should have no impact on your local installation(s) of these packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/MFlowCode/MFC && cd MFC
```

+ Build MFC and its dependencies with `<N>` threads in `release` mode:

```
./mfc.py --build -j <N>
```

+ Run MFC's tests to make sure it was correctly built and your environment is adequate

```
./mfc.py --test
```

## Configuring `mfc.py`

The `mfc.py` script used in the previous section is configured through the file named `mfc.conf.yaml`. 

### Compilers

In the `compilers` section you can specify which compilers you wish to have used. Entries representing the name to an executable locatable through your system's `$PATH` or an absolute path to an executable are valid. The default configuration is:

```yaml
compilers:
  regular:
    c:       gcc
    c++:     g++
    fortran: gfortran
  mpi:
    c:       mpicc
    c++:     mpicxx
    fortran: mpif90
```

### Compiler Configurations

The `configurations` section within `compilers` consists of a list of "compiler configurations", describing modifications for including but not limited to "release" and "debug" builds. You can freely modify the existing configurations and add your own. Here is the description of "release":

```yaml
- name: release
  flags:
    c:       -O3
    c++:     -O3
    fortran: -O3 -cpp -w
```

To use a desired compiler configuration with `mfc.py`, you must specify the `--compiler-configuration` (a.k.a `-cc`) option, along with the name of your configuration. `release` is its default value. For example, to build MFC and its dependencies in `debug` mode, you can run:

```
./mfc.py --build -cc debug
```

### Targets

The largest section of `mfc.conf.yaml` is labeled `targets`, containing a list of targets. A target is defined as an entity on which `mfc.py` can run `--build` or `--test`. `mfc.conf.yaml` contains a target for each dependency and MFC component, and for MFC as a whole. Targets have the following general format:

```yaml
- name: <target name> # The name of the target
  type: <target type> # The type of target (defined bellow) 
  <type>:             # The structure associated with the target's type (defined bellow)
     ...
  depends: # A list of the names of the targets this target depends on
  - ...
  build:   # A list of commands that build the target
  - ...
  test:    # A list of commands that run the target's tests
  - ...
```

The target's `type` refers to which method is used for fetching its source code, and associated metadata to check for updates. Here is a description of its possible values and associated structures:

+ Download

```yaml
type: download
download:
  version: <version>
  link:    <archive download link>
```

+ Clone

```yaml
type: clone
clone:
  git:  <git repository link>
  hash: <commit hash>
```

+ Source

```yaml
type: source
source:
  source: <absolute path to the directory where to run commands>
```

To build a desired target and its dependencies, you must specify the `--targets` (a.k.a `-t`) option, along with the name of your targets separated by spaces. `MFC` is its default value. To build a target and its dependencies from scratch, add the `--scratch` option.

For example, to build MFC's simulation component and its dependencies from scratch, you can run:

```
./mfc.py --build -t MFC_Simulation --scratch
```

### Miscellaneous

+ Use the `--jobs <N>` (a.k.a `-j <N>`) option to build with a certain number of threads.
+ Use the `--set-current <name>` (a.k.a `-sc <name>`) option to select explicitly which compiler configuration to use when running MFC.

```
./mfc.py --build -t MFC_Simulation -cc debug -j 8 --scratch
./mfc.py --test
./mfc.py --set-current debug
```

# Running

The MFC can be run by changing into
a case directory and executing the appropriate Python input file.
Example Python input files can be found in the 
`example_cases` directories, and they are called `input.py`.
Their contents, and a guide to filling them out, are documented
in the user manual. A commented, tutorial script
can also be found in [example_cases/3d_sphbubcollapse/](example_cases/3D_sphbubcollapse/)
MFC can be executed as  

```
./input.py MFC_PreProcess
```

which will generate the restart and grid files that will be read 
by the simulation code. Then  

```
./input.py MFC_Simulation
```

will execute the flow solver. The last (optional) step
is to post treat the data files and output HDF5 databases
for the flow variables via  

```
./input.py MFC_PostProcess
```
